Rbcurse Tutorial
================


The following is a simple introduction to [rbcurse-core ](https://github.com/rkumar/rbcurse-core), a ruby ncurses windowing toolkit to create "graphical" user interfaces for terminals or character based interfaces. For more details, please refer examples in the examples folder of the distribution. 

I am in the process of updating this tutorial based on an ancient tutorial which lies on rubyforge which I can no longer update due to some "Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)" error.
