Tutorial for rbcurse-core (ruby wrapper for ncurses)

[Tutorial](./md/tut0.md)

[Tutorial html](./html/tut0.html)

Sadly, the html files come as source, i did not realize that. I suppose you will have to clone this and then open the html files in a browser. Or click the MD files, github will display them fine.
